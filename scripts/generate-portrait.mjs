/**
 * Derive every rendition of the author portrait from one master file.
 *
 *   node scripts/generate-portrait.mjs     (or: npm run images:portrait)
 *
 * Master:  src/assets/about/josh-suit.png  (1254x1254, kept out of public/ so
 *          the 2 MB original is never deployed).
 * Output:  public/images/about/josh-suit-*.{avif,webp,jpg}
 *
 * Three art-directed crops, because the photo is used at three very different
 * sizes and a single square would waste bytes or lose the face:
 *
 *   portrait  4:5, full torso — the editorial figure on /, /about, /style-guide.
 *   avatar    1:1, tight on the head — the 72-96px byline mark on blog posts.
 *   social    1:1, full frame at 1200px — the Person JSON-LD `image`. JPEG only;
 *             crawlers are not reliable about AVIF/WebP.
 *
 * Crop windows are hand-placed against the master's face (centre x≈625, eyes
 * y≈470). If the master is ever re-shot, re-check them here rather than
 * trusting a face detector.
 *
 * `sharp` is not declared here as a direct dependency by accident — it is
 * declared in devDependencies precisely so this script does not rely on Astro's
 * transitive copy.
