# Discrepancy Review — IVFCRYO interviews

**Sources cross-referenced**

- `src/assets/projects/logatot/wires-and-flows/_src/08-calendar.html` (Logatot — calendar & drills wireframe)
- `src/pages/projects/interview-notes/ivfcryo/don-fish.md` (Don, Owner)
- `src/pages/projects/interview-notes/ivfcryo/sasha-jenkins.md` (Sasha, Office Manager)

**Purpose:** flag anywhere the interviews conflict with one another.

## 0. Read this first — the Logatot file is a different project

The requested cross-reference file, `08-calendar.html`, belongs to **Logatot**, a
home-daycare management product. It is a month calendar with fire-drill and
shelter-in-place logging, tuition dates, and licensing visits. It shares **no
domain facts** with the IVFCRYO fertility-shipment interviews — no couriers, no
cryogenics, no specimens, no service guarantee.

Because the two describe unrelated systems, the Logatot sheet **cannot be in
factual conflict** with the interviews. There is nothing to reconcile between
"time to full exit: 2:14" on a fire-drill record and "−130 °C at specimen storage
level" on a shipment. I have not invented conflicts to fill the section.

> If the intent was to compare the interviews against an **IVFCRYO** wireframe

*(A legitimate, non-conflicting relationship to Logatot is noted in §4.)*

## 1. Hard contradictions between the interviews — **none found**

Every quantitative or named fact that appears in **both** interviews is
consistent. The two accounts were evidently reconciled on the specifics:

| Fact | Don (Owner) | Sasha (Office Manager) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRYO Shield protection tiers | "$25,000 or $50,000 per client and tissue type" (L151) | "$25,000 or $50,000 per client and tissue type" (L167) | ✅ Match |
| "Per client / per tissue type" scoping | Stated (L151) | Restated + emphasized for multi-tissue orders (L185) | ✅ Match |
| Claim temperature threshold | "warmer than minus 130 °C at specimen storage level… calibrated equipment" (L155) | "warmer than minus 130 °C at the specimen storage level, measured with appropriate calibrated equipment" (L175) | ✅ Match |
| IVFCRYO-Sense telemetry fields | GPS, internal temp, outside/ambient temp, humidity, atmospheric pressure (L79) | GPS, internal shipper temp, outside temp, humidity, atmospheric pressure (L213) | ✅ Match |
| Customer-experience contact model | "we assign someone from our customer experience team to the case" (L17-ish) | "A customer experience agent is assigned… the patient's primary contact" (L17) | ✅ Match |
| Dedicated medical courier (direct, no unrelated stops) | Described at length | Described, plus the patient misconception it doesn't remove prep | ✅ Match |
| Update channels | phone, email, text, website tracking | phone, email, text, online tracking | ✅ Match |

**Bottom line:** there is no instance where Don and Sasha state incompatible
values for the same fact.

## 2. Asymmetries — facts stated by only one interviewee

These are **omissions, not contradictions.** Each is a claim one person makes and
the other simply never addresses. Worth logging because a reader cross-checking
the two could mistake an omission for a disagreement, and because a case study
that cites only one source for a number should know it is single-sourced.

| Fact | Only in | Note |
|---|---|---|
| "More than one million reproductive tissue shipments"; "decades of experience" | **Don** (L9) | Company scale/credibility claim. Single-sourced. |
| Long-term storage "near minus 196 °C" | **Don** (L69) | Sasha cites only the −130 °C claim threshold, never −196 °C. Not a conflict — different figures for different things (storage temp vs. claim threshold). |
| IVFCRYO-One: "below minus 150 °C for vapor storage," liquid-submersion + vapor | **Don** (L117) | Equipment spec. Sasha discusses IVFCRYO-One's monitoring but not the −150 °C vapor figure. |
| CRYO Shield "**30-day** claim submission period" | **Sasha** (L177) | Don lists claim evidence requirements but never states the 30-day window. If the write-up asserts 30 days, Sasha is the only source. |
| Phrase "primary contact throughout the process" | **Sasha** (L17) | Don describes the same role/behavior without that label. |

⚠️ **Watch item:** the −196 °C / −150 °C / −130 °C figures are three *different*
measurements (long-term storage / IVFCRYO-One vapor spec / claim threshold).
They are easy to conflate into a false contradiction. They are not in conflict —
but any downstream copy must keep them distinct.

---

## 3. Framing / emphasis differences (not factual conflict)

The interviews diverge in **perspective**, which is expected given the roles, and
they do not contradict:

- **Vantage point.** Don speaks from ownership and whole-process responsibility
  ("maintaining control across organizational boundaries"). Sasha speaks from
  day-to-day coordination (chasing forms across email/fax/portal, finding the
  right lab contact). Different altitude, same system.
- **The "one thing to fix first."** They **agree**, which is notable: both name a
  shared readiness workflow that both facilities confirm before a courier is
  scheduled (Don L321-ish "a truly shared readiness workflow"; Sasha L377 "a
  shared readiness checklist that both facilities must confirm"). This is
  corroboration, not conflict.
- **CRYO Shield emphasis.** Don frames it as a declared-value/legal mechanism;
  Sasha frames it as something patients *misunderstand* ("guarantee/insurance"
  vs. the specific terms). Complementary, not contradictory.

## 4. The only legitimate Logatot cross-reference: shared design principles

Since a direct factual comparison is impossible (§0), the honest link between the
Logatot calendar sheet and the IVFCRYO interviews is that **the same design
convictions surface in both** — as parallels, not conflicts:

| Principle | Logatot `08-calendar.html` | IVFCRYO interviews |
|---|---|---|
| **Encode by shape, never colour alone** | Event type carried by border style — solid/dashed/dotted — so a B&W print still distinguishes drill from outing (note 2, L313) | Don & Sasha both stress transparency without alarm; the case study's "text, icon, and shape, never colour alone" rule. Same accessibility conviction. |
| **Structured records over free text** | Participants are a ticked roster, not a typed list, because "a year later… whether one specific child was in the building" needs a structured record (note 4, L315) | Both interviewees stress accurate, structured order/facility data; "sent is not approved," documentation as a safety system. |
| **Capture = proof** | "Logging the drill and proving the drill are the same action" (L117, note 5) | CRYO Shield: "the claims process begins long before a claim exists" — capture the calibrated temp and photos at receiving, or the event can't be reconstructed. |
| **Print/handoff is a designed surface** | Compliance report assembled from records; print styles neutralise theme (note 6, L317) | Documentation must survive an investigation across multiple orgs; records "protect the patient, the facilities, the courier, and us." |

These are **thematic agreements**, and they belong in a "design system / recurring
principles" note — not in a conflict log.

## Summary

1. **No hard contradictions** exist between the Don and Sasha interviews. Shared
   numbers ($25k/$50k, −130 °C, IVFCRYO-Sense fields) match exactly.
2. The only differences are **one-sided omissions** (§2) — most importantly the
   **30-day claim window (Sasha only)** and **the million-shipments / −196 °C /
   −150 °C figures (Don only)** — and **role-based framing** (§3).
3. Keep the **−196 / −150 / −130 °C** figures distinct; they are the likeliest
   source of a *manufactured* discrepancy.
4. The **Logatot file is a different project** and cannot conflict with the
   interviews; its only real relationship is shared design principles (§4).
